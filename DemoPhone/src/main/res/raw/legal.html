                copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly

                <p><strong>3. Grant of Patent License</strong>. Subject to the terms

                (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
                offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
                license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor

                combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
                Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against

                that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
                direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the
                date such litigation is filed.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Redistribution</strong>. You may reproduce and
                distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,

                You meet the following conditions:</p>

                <li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
                copy of this License; and</li>

                <li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
                that You changed the files; and</li>

                <li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
                distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
                the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
                any part of the Derivative Works; and</li>

                <li>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
                then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
                of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
                those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
                at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
                if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
                by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
                appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
                and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
                within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
                the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
                notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
                provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
                reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
                Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
                distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
                this License.
                </li>

                explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for
                inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
                conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
                terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
                regarding such Contributions.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Trademarks</strong>. This License does not grant
                permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product
                names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
                in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
                NOTICE file.</p>
                <p><strong>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</strong>. Unless required by
                applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and
                each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
                WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
                without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
                NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You
                are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
                redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise
                of permissions under this License.</p>
                <p><strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong>. In no event and
                under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
                otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
                grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
                of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including
                but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
                failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
                even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                damages.</p>
                <p><strong>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</strong>.
                While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
                to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
                However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
                and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
                and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
                harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
                Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
                liability.</p>

                            <li>1.3.1. <b>Availability</b>. If you own or control Necessary Claims, the licenses set forth in
                                Section 1 are subject to and will become effective starting on the date that you make a

                            <li>1.3.2. <b>Additional Conditions</b>. This license is directly from me to you and you acknowledge as a condition of benefiting
                                from it that no rights from me are received from suppliers, distributors, or otherwise in connection with this license.
                                This license is not an assurance (i) that any of my issued patent claims covers a Specification Implementation or Code
                                Implementation or are enforceable or (ii) that a Specification Implementation or Code Implementation would not infringe
                                intellectual property rights of any third party.</li></ol></li>
                        <li>1.4. <b>Termination</b>. All rights, grants, and promises made by me to you under Section 1 are immediately terminated if you or
                            your agent file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against me or any person or entity asserting that a

                            Implementation Claims, unless that suit was in response to a corresponding suit regarding a Specification Implementation
                            or Code Implementation first brought against you. In addition, all rights, grants, and promises made by me to you under
                            Section 1 are terminated if you, your agent, or successor in interest seek to license Necessary Decoder Claims for
                            Specification Implementations or Necessary Reference Implementations Claims for Code Implementations on a royalty-bearing
                            basis, unless that royalty-bearing licensing activity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, reasonable and
                            non-discriminatory royalty-free licensing terms for Necessary Decoder Claims for Specification Implementations or
                            Necessary Reference Implementation Claims for Code Implementations. This Agreement may also be terminated, including back

                        Specification Implementation and 2) to my Necessary Reference Implementations Claims solely for your Code Implementation.</li>
                    <li>3. <b>Past Skype Declarations</b>. You may, at your option, continue to rely on the terms set forth in Skype’s past declarations
                        made to the IETF for the Opus Audio Codec, subject to the terms of those declarations and in lieu of the terms of this

                        my obligations under this Agreement. In addition, I will not 1) seek an injunction or exclusion order against a) Code
                        Implementations for Necessary Reference Implementation Claims or b) Specification Implementations for Necessary Decoder
                        Claims or 2) require that an implementer license its patents back to me, except for Necessary Reference Implementation
                        Claims for Code Implementations and Necessary Decoder Claims for Specification Implementations. I will not transfer
                        Necessary Reference Implementation Claims or Necessary Decoder Claims unless the transferee is subject to these obligations.</li>
                    <li>5. <b>Disclaimers</b>. I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of
                        merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification or Reference

                        Code Implementation is assumed by the implementer and user. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR
                        LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF

                        OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. Nothing in this
                        Agreement requires me to undertake a patent search.</li>

                            1) the Reference Implementation, or 2) an implementation that, in the case of an encoder, produces a bitstream that can be
                            decoded by a Specification Implementation solely to the extent it produces such a bitstream, and, in the case of decoder,
                            is a Specification Implementation, where that Specification Implementation may also infringe Necessary Reference

                            required portions (including the required elements of optional portions) of the decoder Specification that are described
                            in detail and not merely referenced in the Specification.</li>
                        <li>6.7. <b>Necessary Reference Implementation Claims</b>. “Necessary Reference Implementation Claims” are those patent claims that a
                            party owns or controls, including those claims acquired after the date of this declaration, that are necessarily infringed

                   transfer, and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this
                   implementation of the WebRTC code package, where such license applies
                   only to those patent claims, both currently owned by Google and
                   acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily

                   institution of patent litigation against any entity (including a
                   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this
                   implementation of the WebRTC code package or any code incorporated
                   within this implementation of the WebRTC code package constitutes
                   direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
                   infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
                   for this implementation of the WebRTC code package shall terminate as
                   of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
